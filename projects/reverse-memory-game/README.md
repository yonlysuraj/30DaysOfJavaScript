# Reverse Memory Game

The Reverse Memory Game is a fun and challenging memory game where you must recall a sequence of colors in reverse order. With each successful recall, the sequence length increases, making the game progressively harder.

2. **Start Game**: Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
3. **Memorize Colors**: A color will briefly appear on one of the grid squares. Memorize its position.
4. **Recall Sequence**: After the color disappears, click the grid squares in the reverse order of the sequence shown.
5. **Level Up**: If you recall the sequence correctly, a new color will be added to the sequence. Continue to recall the sequence in reverse order as the length increases.
